            <strong>Meet in Public Settings:</strong> Always choose public venues for your first few meetings — cafés, community centers, or public parks. Avoid private or secluded areas until you feel fully comfortable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inform Someone You Trust:</strong> Tell a friend or family member where you're going, who you're meeting, and when you expect to return. Share your location if possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plan Your Own Transportation:</strong> Drive yourself, use public transport, or a ride-share service. Avoid relying on your date for transportation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stay Sober and Alert:</strong> Alcohol and drugs can impair your judgment. Stay aware of your surroundings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Guard Your Personal Belongings:</strong> Keep your phone, wallet, and valuables with you at all times. Never leave drinks or items unattended.

          <li>
            <strong>End the Date If Needed:</strong> Trust your instincts. If uncomfortable, leave early. Your safety comes first.

            <strong>Be Wary of Overly Pushy Behavior:</strong> Anyone pressuring for quick physical contact or personal info is a red flag.

            <strong>Observe Body Language and Vibe:</strong> Trust tone, energy, and body language. If something feels off, it might be.
